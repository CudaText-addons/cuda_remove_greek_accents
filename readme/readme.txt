plugin for CudaText.
the idea is from Sublime Text plugin.

original description:

  Using ST3 built-in “Convert to Upper Case” for Greek is not very convenient
  since capital letters in Greek don't require accents. It's easy to change from
  Ελληνικά to ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΆ but then you need to change ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΆ to ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ, which
  means more typing. This package automates the process of removing accents from
  your selection.

CudaText plugin gives one command. it handles the selection, or entire text if nothing selected.
